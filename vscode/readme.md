vscode extension for [elm](https://elm-lang.org/) using [elm-language-server-rs](https://github.com/lue-bird/elm-language-server-rs). Having it installed is a strict requirement.

## (not used, yet!) extension settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `elm-language-server-rs.elmPath`: The path to your elm executable.
- `elm-language-server-rs.elmFormatPath`: The path to your elm-format executable.
- `elm-language-server-rs.elmTestPath`: The path to your elm-test executable.

## setup for developing
```bash
npm install
```
Open in vscode and press `F5` (or navigate to "run and debug" and click the start button) to open a new window with the compiled extension enabled.
